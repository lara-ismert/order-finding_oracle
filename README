Let $N$ be an integer larger than 2, and let $n$ be the bit length of $N$.
In this repository, I implement the order-finding oracle in 
Shor's algorithm, which is comprised of multiple controlled-$U_{a^j}$ gates, 
where each $U_{a^j}$ implements multiplication by $a^j \mod N$ on the computational basis
vectors with labeling in $Z_{2^n}$.

Our first implementation comes from Beauregard's article 
*Circuit for Shorâ€™s algorithm using 2n+3 qubits*.
